## Install

```sh
npm install
```

This will install lerna first. Lerna is needed to bootstrap our frontend and backend apps.

```sh
npm run bootstrap
```

This project is built with lerna so we have to run this command instead of the usual `npm install`. What this command will do is it will run `npm install` in the directories that is specified in `lerna.json`.

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
